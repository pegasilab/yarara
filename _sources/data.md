# Data format


## Normalized spectra

Before processing by YARARA, the spectra reduced by RASSINE, with prefix `RASSINE_`, must be copied from the `STACKED/` directory to a new 
`WORKSPACE/` directory.

In addition, the data must be in a path where the last subfolders are `{STARNAME}/data/s1d/{INSTRUMENT}/`, where `STARNAME` is the name of the star
and `INSTRUMENT` is the name of the instrument (usually `HARPS03` or `HARPN`).
